# Deploying with Docker on Linux Servers

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool that simplifies the management of multi-container [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) applications. It allows you to define and run complex applications using a simple YAML file, specifying the services, networks, and volumes needed, making it easier to orchestrate and manage multiple Docker containers as a single application.

## Warnings

If you want a test environment or a dev environment, please have a look at the [Developers Setup for Docker documentation](../developers/Developer-Setup-for-Docker)
